## If you want to submit your own version:
* fork this repository
* create your version in a new master folder with a unique name (it must be contained inside this "other versions" folder)
* inside the "your" master folder place your project composed as follows:
    (a) game cards
    b) rules / instructions
    c) readme.md file with any explanations
* Make a PR to request that the file be merged with the original project
* respect the terms of the original license, your license must be the same (not more permissive than the original)

You can create as many new versions as you want but they must be included in separate folders within a single master folder with a unique name
